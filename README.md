# Archie Studio

## About the Project

Archie Studio is a website created as part of an assessment for Lapomps. The project showcases modern web technologies, interactive design, and features smooth scroll and parallax effects using Locomotive Scroll. The text animations are implemented with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The application is designed to fulfill the requirements of the assessment and highlights the integration of these technologies to create a visually appealing and engaging user experience.

Please note that while the current version of the project demonstrates the use of smooth scroll, parallax effects, and text animations, certain functionalities may be limited or non-operational as the focus is primarily on fulfilling the assessment criteria.
